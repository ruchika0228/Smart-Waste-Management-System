# Smart-Waste-Management-System
============================================================

Urbanization brings many benefits, but also significant challenges, one of the most pressing being waste management. Here, we propose a multi-pronged approach for a more effective system:

Reduce: Promote responsible consumption to minimize unnecessary waste generation.
Reuse: Encourage practices like product repair and upcycling to extend the lifespan of items.
Recycle: Implement a robust recycling system with efficient sorting and processing.
Optimizing Waste Collection with Smart Technology

Traditional waste collection often faces inefficiencies. Regularly emptying numerous recycling bins across a vast urban area can be resource-intensive. Here's where  Smart Trash Management comes in:

Internet of Things (IoT) Integration: Sensors within each recycling bin track fill levels, predicting when the container needs emptying.
Data-Driven Optimization: This data optimizes collection routes, avoiding unnecessary trips and reducing environmental impact.
Improved Efficiency: Regular bin emptying ensures cleanliness and prevents overflowing bins.
Project:  Smart Container Emptying Prediction

This project aims to develop a more accurate method for predicting when a recycling container needs emptying. Here's the breakdown:

Legacy System Evaluation: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the existing emptying prediction model.
Baseline Establishment: Measure the accuracy of the current system to establish a benchmark for improvement.
Exploration of Alternative Solutions: Research various approaches for more precise container fill-level prediction.
Pilot Testing: Implement and test the most promising solutions identified in the research phase.
Evaluation and Improvement: Analyze the results, compare them to the existing system, and identify areas for further development.
Machine Learning to the Rescue

This project explored various methodologies, including:

Improved Legacy Model: Refining the existing manually constructed model.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizing algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest classifiers.
Results and Success

By implementing machine learning algorithms, we significantly improved the classification accuracy and recall of the emptying prediction model:

Accuracy increased from 86.8% to 99.1%.
Recall increased from 47.9% to 98.2%.
The Random Forest classifier emerged as the most effective solution, enhancing prediction accuracy by 12.3% and recall by 50.3%. Additionally, it improved other metrics like F1 score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in optimizing waste management systems. By accurately predicting container emptying times,  Smart Trash Management reduces unnecessary collection trips, lowers costs, and contributes to a more sustainable future for our cities.
